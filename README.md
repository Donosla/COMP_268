# COMP268
COMP 268 - Introduction to Computer Programming (Java)

This was my first computer science course.

Taken from course website http://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/comp/comp268.php

Overview
COMP 268 builds on the concepts introduced in COMP 200 and/or COMP 210, and shows how to use various Java language constructs to develop 
code and solve problems using a hands-on approach. That is, for each topic, students are expected to design, write, and analyze Java code
corresponding to that topic.

The course covers seven chapters from the textbook. Course material is a mix of text, video clips, discussion opportunities, and coding
activities. While reading the text and coding in Java remain the main activities, students are also asked to reflect on their programming
efforts as a way to increase their problem-solving and critical analysis skills.

Each student will be assigned a tutor to consult; students are also welcome to consult with the course coordinator, if needed.

Students should not skip studying any chapter, since concepts learned in one unit will play a role in understanding a higher-level concept 
in following units.

Learning Outcomes
Students successfully completing this course will be able to:
  - demonstrate the principles of object-oriented programming.
  - associate the features and elements of the Java programming language with problems and solutions.
  - apply and analyse the concepts of program fundamentals, statement, control flow, and recursion.
  - apply, explain, and compare the concepts of class, object, method, constructor data abstraction, function abstraction, inheritance, 
    overriding, overloading, and polymorphism.
  - write code, test, and analyse input/output, program with basic data structures using array, dynamic
  - develop and publish applets with the functionality of exception handling.
  - apply, analyze, write, debug, and test programs in Java.
  - write code and test graphical user interfaces in Java.
  
Outline
The course consists of the following study guide units based on seven chapters of the textbook:

  - Unit 0: Orientation
  - Unit 1: The Mental Landscape
  - Unit 2: Names and Things
  - Unit 3: Control
  - Unit 4: Subroutines
  - Unit 5: Objects and Classes
  - Unit 6: Introduction to GUI Programming
  - Unit 7: Arrays
